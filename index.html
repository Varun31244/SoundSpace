    <p>Exploring how music impacts teenagers' emotions, identity, and mental health.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      I created Sound Space to explore how music affects teenagers like me. Music is more than entertainment—
      it influences our emotions, shapes our identity, and helps us cope with stress or celebrate life.

  <section id="research">
    <h2>What Research Says</h2>
    <p>
      Studies show that music can boost mood, improve focus, and even help manage anxiety. However, certain genres
      or lyrics can also increase negative emotions if not balanced. Teenagers often use music as a coping tool, a way
      to express themselves, or to feel understood.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Music is powerful. It helps teens feel heard, express emotions, and find comfort. But it’s important to choose
      songs that uplift and don’t harm our mental health. Sound Space is a reminder to use music wisely — and let it
      empower us.
